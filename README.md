# Unity-Racing-Game
Instructional materials for building a racing game in Unity.

This course is intended as a set of suggested goals for building a kart racer game with weapons and powerups. Hints for guiding your own research are included, and for some concepts an example C# script may be provided. The intended audience for this lesson is Unity learners who have already been introduced to the basics of the editor and are seeking more practice in self-directed C# scripting.

The setting and theme of your game are up to you! If you need inspiration, play or watch some examples of the kart racer genre, such as Mario Kart, Kirby Air Ride, or Twisted Metal, or look at more traditional racing games such as Cruisin' USA.
